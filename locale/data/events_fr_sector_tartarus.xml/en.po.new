"\tThe fight, according to Eargen intel, lasted less than ten seconds, with the entire crew having been killed in a particularly gruesome fashion. Analysis of biohazardous matter on the walls suggested that most of the crew died because their heads burst, with all of their nerve cells having been charred to a crisp. Leo was reported missing, and the ship immediately vanished following the fight; it is likely he was abducted."
