"This time you decide to immediately start reading the next bounty. It tells the story of the morphs, gray blobs invented and genetically engineered by the shell people. All identical and all part of a single being, something that can easily start a gray matter incident. Their main talent was the ability to replicate other organisms to near perfection, with only slightly less durability and being unable to change colors. \n"
"\t\n"
"\tHowever, not all morphs were made identically, as other branches of shell science took to make their own \"morphs\", though they focused on mimicking other things. Technomorphs focused on mimicking electrical beings and drones, while Malforms were able to mimic highly powerful members of specific species.\n"
"\t\t  \n"
"\tThat's where your target fits in. After morphing into a strange garden gnome, this morph was able to perfectly mimic individual people down to their very unique attributes. Not only that, unlike the other morphs, durability wasn't an issue - the copy was perfect, sometimes making them even more effective than the copied person themselves. The only drawback being that the morph (who named themselves Pok) couldn't hold the desired form for long, having to constantly switch between multiple forms to stay stable.\n"
"\t\t  \n"
"\tThe bounty does make a point in saying that the morph wasn't made by either the Rebels or the Shells, the only known factions who use morphs. Not only that, but that morph is filled with elements not present in any universe known so far."

"You waste no time and start reading the next bounty. It details the story of one of the harmony's most useful engi defenders, one which never strayed far from any nodes, and thus was never at risk of becoming a separatist. Unfortunately, little did they know that an outside force would be the one to destroy their flawless reputation. No one knows exactly how it happened, all that's known is that the engi vanished for a single week before just... reappearing back where he was before - however, something about him had changed, something that couldn't be fixed no matter how many times he was rebooted or wiped: a desire to become \"alive\", to get a \"soul\".\n"
"\t\t  \n"
"\tThe way it tried doing that was one that most who know of would rather forget. The Engi kidnapped dozens of living beings and killed them in the most painful ways, all in the pursuit to acquire a \"soul\" of their own. The amount of pain that engi managed to create was staggering, but in the end, they were successful. After years of experiments, they eventually managed to get something resembling a soul. However, they weren't able to keep it for long - the harmony eventually had to resort to extreme measures to put that deviation to an end, and since reintegration has the risk of infecting the whole network, it was deemed that killing them the normal way was the least dangerous option, and so, after a long battle, he was finally put to rest."

When pressed for details the leech had what seemed to be a stroke before dying, his body's natural regeneration seemingly being shut down by whoever attacked the ship.
