"The next bounty on your list has the shortest entry so far. Leo, a Leech Ampere, was stationed at the boarders of the Eargen Capital, leading a mostly unremarkable existence marked by the occasional battle with pirates or Rebels. One day, however, his life was flipped upside down by a vessel of unknown make and class, rushing towards the center of the system.\n"
"\n"
"\tThe fight, according to Eargen intel, lasted less than ten seconds, with the entire crew having been killed in a particularly gruesome fashion. Analysis of biohazardous matter on the walls suggested that most of the crew died because their heads burst, with all of their nerve cells having been charred to a crisp. Leo was reported missing, and the ship immediately vanished following the fight; it is likely he was abducted."
