"\t\"Hey kid, before you go, we've got one final proposition for you...\n"

"\t\n"
"\tNow, I don't want to alarm you, but the bounty targets aren't...the usual types. They call themselves the \"haunts\", funnily enough, but they aren't the ones you just fought they are...something else.\n"
"\t\n"
"\tThe reason we never did it ourselves is... well...how do I put this...The ghosts are ACTUAL GHOSTS! No bundles of gasses or angry nebula here, it's legitimately undead creatures. That's all we know about it, we never...actually read any of the bounties\" The leader chuckles awkwardly, looking away.\n"
"\t\n"
"\t\"Look kid, I don't want to force you to accept it, messing with the dead it just...ain't right you know? But we can't do it ourselves, not with this dinky little ship of ours, and besides, we are old now, too old perhaps, a young fella like yourself would surly kick their spectral asses\"\n"
"\t\n"
"\t\"just know, a few tried before us but... none of them ever came back, and I fear whatever cause those ghost to exist might have done the same to them.\"\n"

"\t\"so, what do you say, kid?\""
