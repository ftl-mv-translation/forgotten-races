"PATCH AFTER MULTIVERSE, REQUIRES FUSION 0.1.0+ AND THE RENEGADE COLLECTION, PATCH BOTH OF THOSE BEFORE FR\n"
"\n"
"This mod brings back the in-canon extinct subclass of the Ancients/Obelisks called the \"Commonwealth\". It adds content for the now almost extinct salt people race and a new cruiser line for the Osmians, as well as a brand new sector with unique music and a few unlocks beacons all throughout the game.\n"
"\n"
"Forgotten Races also adds 146 new ships, 141 weapons and drones not counting artilleries (mostly exclusive to said ships), 54 new crews that can be found on the new ships, a revived questline with dozens of unlocks that wasn't implemented to multiverse years ago and 2 new renegade bosses, both with exclusive weapons. Those ships all have some kinda gimmick, not all of them have a very complicated one however.\n"
"\n"
"(Huge thanks to Cyrus, Altzeus, DemonFusion, Alder, Kix, Pepson, Chrono, Arc, Lizzard and Julk who helped this mod a lot over the course of its development; this little addon wouldn't be nowhere near what it is now without their help)\n"
